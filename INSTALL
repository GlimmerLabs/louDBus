Installing louDBus.

0. louDBus is currently only implemented for Linux systems.  So, make
   sure that you're running Linux.

1. Make sure that you have the following installed on your system.

   a. The Racket development tools, such as raco.

   b. A current version of GLib, preferably 2.32 or later.

   c. D-Bus.

2. Type
        make build
   That command should create the appropriate module.

3. Type
        make local-install
   That command should set up a personal installation (not a system
   wide installation) which lets you experiment with the module.

   This target is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

4. When you are satisfied that the system is working appropriately,
   and what to share it with all users, type
        make install
   That command should set up a system-wide installation.

   This target is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

5. When you want to clean up after yourself, type
        make clean
   That *should* remove all of the detritus from the installation.
