This to-do list is presented in no particular order.

[ ] Add a tool for convert standard LDLIBS to the form appropriate
    for raco ctool.   Then, update the Makefile to use it.

[ ] Reorganize the C code for clarity.  (Perhaps separate files, perhaps
    just a table of contents.)

[ ] Add support for additional types

    [ ] Characters
    [ ] Variants of integers
    [ ] Variants of doubles
    [ ] Arrays of doubles
    [ ] Structs (maybe - do these differ from tuples?)
    [ ] Others?

[ ] Add additional functions

    [X] (loudbus-method-info PROXY METHOD-NAME) - Get information ona 
        particular method.
    [X] (loudbus-services) - List all the available services.
    [ ] (loudbus-objects SERVICE) - List all of the available objects
        on a service.
    [ ] (dbus-interfaces SERVICE OBJECT) - List all of the available
        interfaces for an object.
